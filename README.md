# hello_world
I've been working off and on to learn Python and other code for about 15 years and am publishing my work for the first time as a re-dedication to continued learning.

## A little more about me
I have a background in International Relations 🌐, experience designing lesson plans and facilitated trainings for middle-school through adult learners 🍎, and building community engagement with a team of dedicated volunteers for a professional society 🤹 

## What I'm most proud of
Continuously learning. :joy:
